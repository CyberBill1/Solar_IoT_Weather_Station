#General Project Setup and Working Principle

Here’s a breakdown of the project’s components and key aspects, addressing potential points of confusion:
Purpose
This is a solar-powered IoT weather station built around an ESP32 microcontroller. It measures temperature and humidity using a DHT22 sensor, publishes the data to AWS IoT Core via MQTT, and optimizes power consumption using deep sleep mode. It’s designed to demonstrate reliability, scalability, and efficiency.
Files
esp32_firmware/weather_station.ino: The ESP32 firmware written in Arduino C++. It handles WiFi, MQTT communication, sensor reading, and power optimization.
power_opt.py: An optional Python script to monitor serial output locally and estimate power efficiency. Useful for testing without AWS if you don’t have AWS set up yet.
README.md: Documentation with setup instructions and placeholders for a demo.
Hardware
ESP32 DevKit: A microcontroller with WiFi capabilities (e.g., NodeMCU ESP32).
Solar Panel (5V, 200mA): Powers the system via a LiPo battery.
LiPo Battery (3.7V, 1000mAh): Stores energy for operation when solar power isn’t available.
TP4056 Charger Module: Manages battery charging from the solar panel.
DHT22 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity, connected to GPIO 4.
Software
Arduino IDE: Used to compile and upload the firmware to the ESP32.
Libraries: WiFi.h, PubSubClient.h (MQTT), and DHT.h (sensor support).
AWS IoT Core: Receives weather data over MQTT and logs metrics to CloudWatch.
Key Features
Deep Sleep: The ESP32 sleeps for 15 minutes between readings to save power.
QoS 1: Ensures reliable MQTT message delivery.
Scalability: Multiple stations can operate by changing the client_id.
Placeholders
You need to replace your_wifi_ssid, your_wifi_password, your-iot-endpoint.iot.region.amazonaws.com, and AWS certificates (ca_cert, client_cert, client_key) with your actual credentials.
Testing Locally
To test this project and generate a demo (e.g., a screenshot for demo.png), you’ll need to set up the hardware, upload the firmware, and verify functionality. Here’s a detailed step-by-step process:

#Prerequisites
Hardware: ESP32 DevKit, DHT22 sensor, solar panel, LiPo battery, TP4056 module, jumper wires, breadboard.
Software: Arduino IDE installed, Python 3 (for power_opt.py), AWS account (optional for full testing).
Tools: USB cable (to connect ESP32 to your computer), MQTT Explorer (optional for MQTT testing).
Step 1: Assemble the Hardware
Connect the DHT22 Sensor:
VCC to ESP32 3.3V pin.
GND to ESP32 GND pin.
Data to GPIO 4 (add a 10kΩ pull-up resistor between VCC and Data).
Connect the Power System:
Solar panel positive (+) to TP4056 IN+, negative (-) to IN-.
TP4056 B+ to LiPo battery positive, B- to battery negative.
TP4056 OUT+ to ESP32 VIN (5V pin), OUT- to ESP32 GND.
Verify Connections:
Ensure the battery charges when the solar panel is in light (TP4056 LED should indicate charging).
Step 2: Set Up the Arduino IDE
Install Arduino IDE:
Download from arduino.cc and install.
Add ESP32 Support:
In Arduino IDE, go to File > Preferences.
Add this URL to “Additional Boards Manager URLs”: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json.
Go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager, search for “ESP32,” and install “esp32” by Espressif.
Install Libraries:
Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Install PubSubClient (by Nick O’Leary), DHT sensor library (by Adafruit).
Step 3: Configure and Upload the Firmware
Open the Code:
Copy the weather_station.ino content into a new Arduino sketch.
Update Credentials:
Replace your_wifi_ssid and your_wifi_password with your WiFi details.
For AWS IoT Core (optional):
Create an IoT Thing in AWS IoT Core, download certificates, and update mqtt_server, ca_cert, client_cert, and client_key.
If skipping AWS for now, comment out MQTT-related code (lines involving client) and add Serial.println(payload) for local testing.
Select Board and Port:
Go to Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino and select “ESP32 Dev Module.”
Connect the ESP32 via USB, then select the port under Tools > Port.
Upload the Code:
Click the upload button (right arrow). Wait for “Done uploading.”
Step 4: Test Basic Functionality (Without AWS)
Open Serial Monitor:
In Arduino IDE, go to Tools > Serial Monitor, set baud rate to 115200.
You should see:
WiFi connected
Failed to connect to MQTT (if AWS not set up)
Published: {"timestamp": "1234", "temperature": 25.5, "humidity": 60.0, "uptime": 1}
The ESP32 will sleep for 15 minutes, then wake and repeat.
Use power_opt.py (Optional):
Install Python dependencies: pip3 install pyserial.
Update SERIAL_PORT in power_opt.py (e.g., /dev/ttyUSB0 on Linux, COM3 on Windows—check Arduino IDE port).
Run: python3 power_opt.py.
Output after 5 minutes shows readings per minute, verifying power efficiency.
Step 5: Test with AWS IoT Core (Full Setup)
Configure AWS IoT Core:
Create a Thing, attach a policy allowing MQTT actions, and download certificates.
Create a CloudWatch log group (WeatherStationMetrics) via an IoT Rule.

#Update Firmware:
Replace AWS placeholders with your endpoint and certificate contents.
Upload again.
Monitor MQTT:
Use MQTT Explorer or AWS IoT Core’s “Test” tab.
Subscribe to weather/data.
Expect JSON messages every 15 minutes:
json
{"timestamp": "1234", "temperature": 25.5, "humidity": 60.0, "uptime": 1}

#Check CloudWatch:
In AWS Console, go to CloudWatch > Logs > WeatherStationMetrics.
Verify uptime and sensor data are logged.
Step 6: Generate the Demo
Screenshot: Capture the Serial Monitor output, MQTT Explorer data, or CloudWatch logs.
Save: Export as demo.png.
Upload to GitHub: As described earlier, use “Add file” > “Upload files” in the repository.
General Working Principle
Here’s how the project operates at a high level:

#Power Management:
The solar panel charges the LiPo battery via the TP4056 module.
The ESP32 runs on battery power, supplemented by solar energy when available.
Data Collection:
The ESP32 wakes from deep sleep every 15 minutes (controlled by SLEEP_DURATION).
The DHT22 sensor reads temperature and humidity via GPIO 4.

#Communication:
The ESP32 connects to WiFi using provided credentials.
It establishes a secure MQTT connection to AWS IoT Core using TLS certificates.
A JSON payload with timestamp, temperature, humidity, and uptime is published to the weather/data topic with QoS 1 (ensuring delivery).
Optimization:
After publishing, the ESP32 disconnects WiFi and MQTT, then enters deep sleep to conserve power.
The 15-minute sleep cycle balances data frequency with battery life.
Scalability:
Multiple stations can run simultaneously by changing client_id (e.g., WeatherStation2), allowing AWS to manage a network of devices.

#Monitoring:
AWS IoT Core forwards data to CloudWatch for logging and analysis.
Locally, power_opt.py can estimate efficiency by counting readings over time.
Flow:
Wake → Connect WiFi → Connect MQTT → Read Sensor → Publish Data → Disconnect → Sleep → Repeat.

#Troubleshooting Tips
No Serial Output: Check baud rate (115200), USB connection, or GPIO 4 wiring.
MQTT Fails: Verify AWS endpoint, certificates, and WiFi stability.
Sensor Errors: Ensure DHT22 wiring and pull-up resistor are correct.
Power Issues: Test solar panel output (multimeter) and battery charge.
